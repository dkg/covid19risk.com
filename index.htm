            <p>
			We are focusing on research that could lead to an app that shows a heat map informed by GPS data, showing the risk levels of surrounding areas. This map could be more fine-grained than Johns Hopkins, while still coarse-grained enough to protect users' privacy.

        <h2>Our Plan</h2>
        <p>
			We believe there's a non-trivial chance that GPS tracking or other sources of location information could reduce the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 by informing individuals of their risk and helping implement better self-quarantine measures. But it's a big undertaking to validate this idea, let alone bring it to deployment. We also think the project should ideally be non-profit.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's likely this approach will not be able to reach development in time to help with COVID-19. However, if this approach can help, time is of the essence -- we need collaborators to help us move rapidly. We're in the early stages of our research, but we have the beginnings of an academic paper on Overleaf, a Github repo with some early code, and a Slack channel. My original  
			<b><a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8chk6DHZXctGHtNoz/covid-19-risk-assessment-app-idea-for-vetting-and-discussion" class="blue">forum post </a></b>
			describes the full potential of an app based on this technology. In the forum post, I also include a Q&A with Sukrit Silas, an expert in infectious diseases, who agrees that the app could help.
		</p>
			While the forum post discusses the idea of GPS tracking, there may be multiple methods besides GPS tracking to accomplish the results we hope to see in the app. We also believe there are more privacy-preserving ways to accomplish this task, such as MAC address logging or Google Nearby, and we are actively pursuing research in these avenues as well.
