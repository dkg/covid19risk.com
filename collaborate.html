		<h2>Collaborate with us</h2>
		<p>
		Right now, we are only two researchers at Stanford and the University of Waterloo working on this project. We are looking for programmers and other researchers (PhDs, postdocs, professors) to join us and collaborate on a project exploring the use of GPS data to inform individuals of their risk and slow the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. We are also looking for a professor to advise us on the project. 
		</p>
		<h3>
		Researchers and programmers with expertise in one (or more!) of the following topics would help us the most:
		</h3>
		<p>
		(1) Epidemiologist or Computational Epidemiologist
		</p>
		<p>
		(2) Public Health Security Researcher, MD or other clinical expert
		</p>
		<p>
		(3) Software engineers
		</p>
		<p>
		(4) Web development experience making scientific visualizations on the web
		</p>
		<p>
		(5) Experience with app development
		</p>
		<h3>
		More details
		</h3>
		<p>
		The software engineer we need is someone who could implement a tool that models disease spread from actual movement patterns of individuals (like 
		<b><a href="https://medium.com/sausheong/simulating-epidemics-using-go-and-python-101557991b20" class="blue">this </a></b>
		but with real life trajectories), with the main output being a real time evolving 
		<b><a href="https://www.covid19risk.com/map.html" class="blue">heat map  </a></b>
		. Our researchers in epidemiology and public health can provide feedback about the relevant factors and constants. We're also taking care of all the boring non-programming stuff, so you can focus on the code.
		</p>
		<p>
		Past experience for researchers that would be helpful includes working with SIR models on dynamic contact graphs or familiarity with estimating transmission probabilities from limited contact data. Someone who could give us guidance estimating transmission probability from duration and distance. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Or, relevant experience in GPS tracking, MAC address logging, Google Nearby, Geospatial or wifi router history, or other ways of evaluating contact networks that could be integrated with current mobile technology to track disease spread.
		</p>
		<p>
		We recommend you read the 
		<b><a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8chk6DHZXctGHtNoz/covid-19-risk-assessment-app-idea-for-vetting-and-discussion" class="blue">forum post </a></b>
		to have the context to understand what you'd be working on and the motivations behind the project. The post was optimistic about what could be accomplished in a short time period, and we are no longer sure about providing scores and recommendations, but we think we may be able to build the heat map referenced in the post with help from other researchers. 
		</p>
		<p>
		If you know any reasons our approach would not work to slow the spread of viruses like COVID-19 please inform us. Also, if you are aware of a similar project that is already further along, please let us know so we can support other efforts instead of duplicating efforts.
		</p>

		if you are interested in collaborating.

		<h3>
		This is currently an independent collaboration in its early stages hoping to bring together researchers across disciplines who are concerned about COVID-19. We haven't yet gotten support from any institutions. These opinions are our own.
