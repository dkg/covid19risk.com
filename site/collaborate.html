<h1 class="orange">Join Our Team</h1>

<p>We&#39;ve grown from a pair of researchers from Stanford and the University of Waterloo into a small, interdisciplinary team - but we still need more help. We are looking for programmers and other researchers (PhDs, postdocs, professors) to join us and collaborate on a project exploring the use of crowdsourced data to inform individuals of their risk and slow the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19.</p>

<h3>Research Roles</h3>

<p>We&#39;re currently looking for people with one (or more!) of the following skills or backgrounds:</p>

<p>(1) General mobile app UI design (iOS and/or Android)</p>

<p>(2) Advanced web development skills, particularly in interactive visualisations</p>

<p>(3) Mobile app development skills</p>

<p>(4) Software project management</p>

<p>(6) Legal expertise around the handling of personal health information</p>

<p>(7) Experience in the fields of data re-identification or privacy research and implementation.</p>

<h3>Support Roles</h3>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t have a skillset directly related to the project&#39;s design or development, there are still ways to help. We&#39;re a rapidly expanding group, and we&#39;re also interested if you have experience in:</p>

<p>(1) Fundraising and grant applications for not-for-profit organisations</p>

<p>(2) Personal or executive assistant roles</p>

<p>(3) Blogging, particularly with a scientific background</p>

<p>(4) Onboarding and orientation into organisations</p>

<h3>Applying</h3>

<p>We recommend you read the <b><a class="blue" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8chk6DHZXctGHtNoz/covid-19-risk-assessment-app-idea-for-vetting-and-discussion">forum post </a></b> to have the context to understand what you&#39;d be working on and the motivations behind the project. The post was optimistic about what could be accomplished in a short time period, and we are no longer sure about providing scores and recommendations, but we think we may be able to build the heat map referenced in the post with help from other researchers.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in collaborating and have one of the skillsets listed above, please contact us at <b><a class="blue" href="mailto: collaborations@covid19risk.com">collaborations@covid19risk.com </a></b> with the role you would like to fill and a brief (~300 words) introduction with your skills and links to previous work.</p>

<h2>Other ways to help</h2>

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>If you have information that you think could be relevant to this project, please send it to us at <b><a class="blue" href="mailto: contact@covid19risk.com">contact@covid19risk.com </a></b> . In particular, we are interested in any other teams that are currently, or were previously, engaged in similar efforts.</p>

<h3>Donations</h3>

<p>We are not taking donations at this time. If you have discretionary income, and you would like to give it to charity, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell.org</a> has a list of excellent causes in need of financial support.</p>

<h3>Awareness</h3>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t have the ability to directly support us right now, consider sharing our project over social media or by word of mouth. To keep up to date with our progress, or to see if a role that suits you becomes available, you can sign up to our newsletter via the form on our <b><a class="blue" href="index.htm">homepage </a></b>.</p>
