<h1 class="orange">Our Advisors</h1>

<p>Given how ambitious and potentially impactful our project is, we want to make sure we do it correctly. A poorly-executed app could easily do more harm than good: warning our users away from areas with no need to while directing them towards high-risk ones, causing unnecessary panic, or lulling people into a dangerously false sense of security.<br />
<br />
To avoid that, we&#39;ve sought out expert advice from subject-matter experts from the very inception of the project. The following academics have gone above and beyond in assisting us, providing advice and support that has helped get the COVID-19 Risk App this far.</p>

<h2>Professor Julie Parsonnet</h2>

<p><img alt="" src="/JParsonnet.jpg" /></p>

<h3>About</h3>

<p>Dr. Parsonnet is an Infectious Diseases Specialist and Epidemiologist at Stanford (Depts. of Medicine and Epidemiology and Population Health). She has a particular interest in gastrointestinal infections, including <em>H. pylori</em> infection and diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis and illnesses with prolonged fever. Dr. Parsonnet also has an active research enterprise in which she studies the way infections contribute to the development of chronic diseases including cancer, allergy and obesity. She has had continuous funding from the National Institutes of Health for over 25 years and has served as a member of numerous advisory boards, professional societies, and scientific review committees.</p>

<h2>Professor Plinio Morita</h2>

<h3>About</h3>

<p>Dr. Morita is a Director of the Ubiquitous Health Technology Lab (UbiLab). His research focuses on population level surveillance, remote patient monitoring (RPM), and personalized medicine&nbsp;technologies to be used to prevent unnecessary visits to hospitals and drive our healthcare system toward&nbsp;community care and telehealth. The current state of the technology limits how clinicians can use data collected from RPM and IoT systems as the quality, frequency, and reliability of the data is normally lower than clinical standards.</p>
