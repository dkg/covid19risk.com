<h1 style="color:#BF3F4A">Our Team</h1>

<p>We&#39;ve grown from a pair of concerned researchers into a rapidly growing group of over fifty volunteers from a range of backgrounds, spread over multiple continents. Here are just some of our key members: this list is far from exhaustive, and we&#39;re getting new offers of help every day, so check back here regularly for more.</p>

<h2>Founders</h2>

<p>Tina and James both independently developed the original concept behind COVID Watch; they joined forces, and Rhys joined soon after.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/TWhite.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Tina White</strong> <strong>- Co-Founder</strong></p>

<p>Tina is a co-founder of COVID Watch. She is involved in leadership, outreach, and research guidance and communication.</p>

<p>Tina is currently enrolled at the Stanford University as a PhD candidate. For her dissertation, she has designed several neural network architectures that are biased to break problems into parts while learning to make aerodynamics predictions from very few examples. She has developed two novel machine learning methods for faster and more accurate reduced order models. She has also invented and patented a method for eliminating transonic flutter in turbomachinery at Honeywell.</p>

<p><strong>James Petrie</strong> <strong>- Co-Founder</strong></p>

<p>James is a co-founder of COVID Watch. He is involved in the numerical modelling and research aspects of the project.</p>

<p>James is currently a PhD candidate in the field of Applied Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. His research has focused on applications of numerical modelling, machine learning, and optimization to fracture mechanics and autonomous robotics. James has a master&rsquo;s degree in Computational Mathematics from the University of Waterloo and a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Engineering Physics from the University of British Columbia.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/RFenwick.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>Rhys Fenwick</strong> <strong>- Co-Founder</strong></p>

<p>Rhys Fenwick is a co-founder of COVID Watch. He is involved in communication and web design, as well as the administrative and programming aspects of the project.</p>

<p>Rhys is a science communicator from the University of Wollongong, Australia with a background in medical biotechnology and software development. He currently works at Science Space, Wollongong as well as doing freelance science communication.</p>

<h2>Key Members</h2>

<p>These are some of the members who have been with us the longest, and who have made significant contributions to the project. They aren&#39;t the only ones, but we couldn&#39;t have made it this far without them.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/MVoloshin.jpeg" /></p>

<p><strong>Mikhail Voloshin</strong> <strong>- Programming and Research</strong></p>

<p>Mikhail is a senior software engineer and team leader with roots in artificial intelligence and machine learning. He is currently the CEO of Mighty Data Inc., a freelance consulting firm with a focus on machine learning and AI.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img alt="" src="/TAlexanian.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Tessa Alexanian</strong> <strong>- Programming and Research</strong></p>

<p>Tessa is an automation and software engineer at Zymergen in Emeryville, CA, a member of several iGEM committees, and an organizer of the East Bay Biosecurity Group.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img alt="" src="/MBonde.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>Mathias Kirk Bonde &ndash; Software Development</strong></p>

<p>Mathias is a Computer Science student and Consultant for IBM where he specializes in prototyping emerging technologies. He has previously played Starcraft competitively and co-authored a machine learning paper on Starcraft. Mathias speaks Danish and English.</p>
