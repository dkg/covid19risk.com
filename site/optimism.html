<h1 style="color:#BF3F4A">Together, We Can Beat COVID-19.</h1>

<p>From a technical perspective, pandemics present a complex challenge. There are many different goals, sometimes competing, that we want to achieve as well as we can. In the case of pandemics, we want to prevent panic, avoid disruption to people&#39;s lives as much as possible, preserve civil and human rights, limit the economic impact - and, above all else, save lives.<br />
<br />
This type of problem - with many different outcomes which must be balanced - is known as an <em>optimisation </em>problem. These outcomes are the criteria by which we must judge interventions, directly or indirectly - including our own. Do we prevent panic and disruption?&nbsp; Preserve rights?&nbsp; Lower costs?<br />
<br />
Most importantly, <em>will this save lives?</em></p>

<p>We believe the answer to all of these questions is yes.</p>

<p>Non-pharmaceutical approaches to limiting the spread of disease generally have two components:</p>

<p><strong>Filtering</strong>: Identifying <em>which </em>people are impacted, followed by</p>

<p><strong>Intervention</strong>: Modifying the behaviour of these people.</p>

<p>For example, quarantining patients with a positive diagnosis applies a filter based on testing and then applies the quarantine intervention. Other examples include travel restrictions for at-risk areas, cancelling public events in a specific city, or encouraging more handwashing in an entire country.</p>

<p>In the case of COVID-19, the main interventions are testing and self-isolation for a period of at least 14 days (the incubation period of the virus). Isolation and testing are incredibly powerful measures: they&#39;re regularly used to stop other infectious diseases in their tracks, and they&#39;re currently our best shot at slowing or stopping COVID-19 around the world.</p>

<p>The downside is that they are also costly to use. If the filtering process is not accurate this could result in a huge number of false positives, and therefore a huge cost incurred in the form of negative impact on peoples&rsquo; lives: many people cannot earn a living in that two weeks, and many people have family or community obligations they would be unable to fulfill. Even that large cost, however, pales in comparison to the benefits. Every individual who fully self-isolates to avoid potentially getting infected and continuing a transmission chain can be expected to, on average, prevent 1 hospitalization for every 4 days of self-isolation. Even on a purely monetary basis, US households spend about $400/week on discretionary economic activity, whereas 1 hospitalization costs about $10,000. In other words, accurate self-isolation saves strained medical systems by allowing them to save beds, personnel, and often limited funds, allowing them to treat more people more effectively.</p>

<p>The importance of a good filter is therefore two-fold: it limits the cost of false positives by ensuring that the only people self-quarantining are those who need to, and means that those people who <em>are </em>told to self-quarantine can be more confident that they really are high-risk, potentially increasing compliance.</p>

<p>The gold standard filter is directly testing for the presence of COVID-19. Unfortunately testing kits are in short supply and not everybody can be tested, while those who are often have to wait hours or even days for the results.</p>

<p>Instead, one commonly used measure is <em>contact tracing</em>: reconstructing the movements of infected individuals and identifying which people they came into contact with during the time they were contagious. In the case of COVID-19, epidemiologists have <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30074-7/fulltext">calculated</a> that with 80% contact tracing accuracy and an average of 3.8 days between the onset of symptoms and detection of the virus, containment is very likely.</p>

<p>The question for us, then, is this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&ldquo;Can an effective contact tracing program reduce local transmission so that sustained local spread does not occur?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>The answer seems to be yes. With a comprehensive testing program, high contact tracing accuracy, and self-isolation of diagnosed individuals, our models predict that each new case will likely cause on the order of 10 other cases before the outbreak is extinguished. It should be noted that not everything is known about this disease yet and models are never perfect. But it seems probable that this can be done, especially based on the recent success China has seen.</p>

<p>So for people asking &ldquo;what happens next?&rdquo;, the options are not just global containment or infection of a majority of the world. We have a third option.</p>

<p>What we need to do is build a system that is capable of rapidly containing local transmission. By doing this we can continue to interact with the rest of the world and any newly introduced cases will at most cause a small number of local infections. Even in the scenario where global containment fails and a vaccine isn&rsquo;t developed for years we can prevent the majority of the local population from getting sick.</p>

<p>We believe that technology can be an important part of this solution. In order to remain operational for years, the contact tracing system must have a low social and economic cost. Mobile technologies can provide instantaneous and high accuracy contact tracing, even between strangers. Instead of requiring thousands of healthcare workers to do this manually (as is the current approach in China) the process will be essentially cost-free. Because the system will be so accurate, a majority of people can continue to live their lives without the need for increased social distancing.</p>

<p>What we are developing is a high-quality filter to be used for the pandemic optimization problem. Combined with a comprehensive testing program, our filter may be powerful enough to protect our communities from COVID-19 becoming endemic.</p>
