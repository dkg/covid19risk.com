          An Inside View
        </h3>
        <p>
        Welcome to our first insight post!<br><br>
        In this series, our researchers will share what they're currently working on and the challenges they're facing.  They will be more technical than our progress posts, but as the name suggests they will hopefully provide some insight into the state of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
        Today's post comes from James Petrie, from the University of Waterloo's Department of Applied Mathematics:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            My main focus is quantifying potential impacts of interventions informed by cellphone-based technology. A few days ago I built a SEIR model for dynamic contact networks (like <b><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep31456" class ="blue">this one</a></b>) and ran it on <b><a href="http://www.sociopatterns.org/publications/data-on-face-to-face-contacts-in-an-office-building-suggest-a-low-cost-vaccination-strategy-based-on-community-linkers/" class="blue">this</a></b> data. I was planning to test interventions like targeted self-quarantine as a function of adoption rate and contact measurement error.<br><br>
        My current challenge is adapting this approach to work with coarse GPS data instead of logged face-to-face interactions. The first problem is test data- the office dataset I was using before won’t work here. The BBC dataset may be useful, but it still won’t be ‘complete’. For now, I’m looking into the possibility of agent-based spatial simulation to artificially generate dynamic contact networks.<br><br>
        The second problem is estimating transmission probability from coarse spatial distance. I’m working on some basic probabilistic arguments for this, but there is a lot of room for refinement and the eventual estimate will likely be fairly low accuracy.<br><br>
        More broadly, I’m trying to think of general use cases. The primary one is a municipality with no initial local infections. They would like to avoid significant disruptions to the economy, so preferably limited travel restrictions and general quarantine. However, other regions have a non-zero infection rate so there will be a steady-state influx of infected individuals. They would like to supplement their existing methods with cellphone-based information. So what can we offer them that will reduce local transmission sufficiently?<br>
        There seem to be a few things that would improve outcomes:<br>
        - increased caution for at-risk individuals<br>
        - early detection of new local outbreaks<br>
        - accurate and immediate contact tracing (especially between strangers)<br>
        Most of this is still in progress, and I’m hoping to have a quantitative model for GPS based interventions built in the next 2-3 days.
