			<h2>Summary Article: 20th of March 2020</h2>

			<p>Rather than an ordinary blog post, this is what much of our team have been working on for most of the past week.
			This is a comprehensive summary of our project, now named COVID Watch.</p>
			<p>
				It covers the what, why, how, when, and where of this project in detail, as well as discusses our progress so far.
				 The aim of doing so is to assist interested parties and organisations in becoming familiar with the project in its entirety.
				 If that sounds like you, this is the place to start.
			</p>

			<p>This article is current as of the 20th of March, 2020.<br />

<h2>Bluetooth Primer: 7th of March 2020</h2>

<p>This project is now roughly two and a half weeks old, and in that time we&#39;ve made significant progress - not just into solving the problems we&#39;d begun with, but in understanding which problems we should be trying to solve in the first place. We have a far deeper understanding of the technologies and challenges.</p>

<p>At the same time, with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases now over 100 000...<br />

<h2>Insight Post: 6th of March 2020</h2>

<p>Welcome to our second insight post!</p>

<p>Today&#39;s post comes from Tina White, a PhD candidate from Stanford University specialising in applied machine learning research. She&#39;s the main organiser here at the COVID-19 Risk App: the below post is a lightly edited version of an internal document. Much of the technical content mentioned has been covered in other blog posts: instead, the insight here is how our project organises and plans...<br />

<h2>Progress Post: 4th of March 2020</h2>

<p>The big news first: we have a proof of concept!<br />
It takes multiple GPS trajectories and runs multiple epidemiological simulations on them based on an assumption of proximity-based transmission and our latest information about COVID-19. It uses these simulations to generate a risk heatmap...<br />

<h2>Insight Post: 28th of February 2020</h2>

<div class="blog-item-excerpt">Welcome to our first insight post!<br />
In this series, our researchers will share what they&#39;re currently working on and the challenges they&#39;re facing. They will be more technical than our progress posts, but as the name suggests they will hopefully provide some insight into the state of the project.<br />
Today&#39;s post comes from James Petrie...</div>

<div class="blog-item-excerpt">Phew! What a week.<br />
We&rsquo;ve gone from two researchers and a <b><a class="blue" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8chk6DHZXctGHtNoz/covid-19-risk-assessment-app-idea-for-vetting-and-discussion">forum post</a></b> to a team of over a dozen, with expert academic advice and support rolling in.<br />
